        <img class="profile-image" src="images/cody_kate_profile.jpg">
        <p>The summer of 2010 was a rough one. Kate and I had recently moved across the

  country to start a new church. I was originally from Louisiana and my wife was from

  Nashville, TN. We met in Haiti (you know typical story). I had just finished a

  seminary degree at Liberty University and we were praying where God would send

  us. We felt called to California and ended up picking Sacramento.

  Within the first couple months we had our trailer stolen, we couldn’t afford one

  piece of furniture, and we were sleeping on a blow up mattress with a hole in it also

  known as the floor. We thought we were being faithful to what God had called us to

  but really had no clue what we were doing. It started a pretty tough time in our

  pretty new marriage. That night I cried into my pillow and vowed never to plant a

  church again.</p>
  <p>

  In May of 2013 I was working for a company that opened a new office in Oceanside,

  CA and we moved. A few months in we met a guy named Jim Britts who was starting

  a new church called Parkside. We had been through this church plant thing before

  and weren’t too excited about it. We went to their first official service on Easter

  2014 and knew God was calling us there.
  </p>
  <p>
  We have seen God’s favor and grace displayed not only in our lives but the lives of

  hundreds of people at Parkside for the last 3 years. I became the Connections

  Pastor at Parkside and we are so thankful for what God has done in our lives, but it

  wasn’t over. In 2016 God began putting it on our hearts to plant a church again in

  the community that we love so much – Oceanside, CA.
  </p>

 <p>

    We are calling it <span class="church-name">Journey Church</span> because we have seen that no matter where you

    are in your journey God will meet you there. He met us in His perfect timing and we

    are looking forward to many others sharing the story of when God entered their

    journey in life. We are thrilled that God is already building an incredible team of

    people to help start Journey. We believe the transcript of our prayers will become

    the script of our church and are excited about what God is going to do.</p>
